## Welcome to our World :earth_asia: . . .
<p align="justify">
With the onset of the Covid 19 pandemic :worried: , people have been forced to stay indoors :house: for their own safety as well as to prevent the virus from spreading . This has been a huge setback to all those NGOs :family: which used to rely heavily on physical modes of communication :mega: in order to spread awareness about the cause they fight for :muscle: . We know that technical assistance :computer: required to bring an organization online , is pretty costly :moneybag: . Hence we at Solvable are commited to try and solve these technical challenges and help NGOs gain an online presence . We provide this sevice for <strong>free</strong> so that NGOs can use their resources for the noble cause they fight for :gem: .
